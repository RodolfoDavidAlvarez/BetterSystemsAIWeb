Create a responsive, multi-step 'Better Systems AI Pre-Questionnaire' web application that follows the same dark, modern, and professional visual style as previously described (charcoal grays, subtle gradients, sleek typography). The look, feel, and branding should remain consistent with the 'Better Systems AI Onboarding' experience, ensuring the user seamlessly transitions into this pre-questionnaire phase.

Overall Guidelines:

Use a progress indicator to show the user’s place in the process.
Keep the UI dark and modern, maintaining the same branding (logo, name, accent colors).
Include clear instructions, labels, tooltips, and placeholder examples throughout.
Ensure all fields are well-organized and easy to understand.
At the end, provide a ‘Submit’ button with a hover effect, and upon completion show a confirmation message: "Thank you! We’ll be in touch soon to discuss your pre-assessment results."
