1,"Deals Vs Agreement","Micah Izquierdo","micahizquierdo13@gmail.com","2025-12-13T22:54:39.772Z","Hey Rodolfo - any way DEALS could just be the jobs with SIGNED agreements?   Agreements - agreements sent out  Deals - Deals sold and Contracts finalized - *filterable by rep*  Proposals - NEW - Any/all proposals generated with a full list of all proposals out. **Also filterable by rep*  I believe this will remove any confusion on what is a solid deal, what is a proposal and what is a legitimate signed contract we can execute and install on. please lmk if any issues with this idea *filterable by rep*  Only filterable by rep available for admin users. This will let us track who's busy and who's not!","open","high","feature_request","CRM Proposal System"

Unsure if this is a bug or programming but when deal was sold I was unable to verify a paint match because the photos wouldn't pop up for me to view","open","high","bug","CRM Proposal System"
3,"Rep Filter","Micah Izquierdo","micahizquierdo13@gmail.com","2025-12-13T22:38:58.201Z","On deals sold - can we please have a dropdown of users that allows us to filter based off who's deal it is? I had a rep ask me about his projects. When we have hundreds - it would be nice to simply select their name and see only their projects so I can discuss with them only their projects and know for sure it is theirs.","open","medium","feature_request","CRM Proposal System"

Can we please remove those from the quoting section of the process? We are charging reps at a cost per linear foot and the cost is included in their redline. I am asking to remove this to remove confusion for reps. I confirmed this one with Vince as well. He agreed we should get rid of it","open","high","feature_request","CRM Proposal System"
