    "message": "Hey Rodolfo - any way DEALS could just be the jobs with SIGNED agreements? \n\nAgreements - agreements sent out\n\nDeals - Deals sold and Contracts finalized - *filterable by rep*\n\nProposals - NEW - Any/all proposals generated with a full list of all proposals out. **Also filterable by rep*\n\nI believe this will remove any confusion on what is a solid deal, what is a proposal and what is a legitimate signed contract we can execute and install on. please lmk if any issues with this idea *filterable by rep*\n\nOnly filterable by rep available for admin users. This will let us track who's busy and who's not!",
